\begin{abstract}
\quad Today baseball is becoming more and more popular and getting new fans. Those who just have put their first step into baseball - find it hard to follow the rules and to understand the changes in the situation. Unlike our baseball league KBO, MLB already has many meaningful methods for in-game analyzing with real time statistics. So we are going to adopt those ideas into KBO league. Winning Probability Added, which is also known as WPA, is one of good factors which allows easy understanding of the situation and the impacts that pitcher or batter makes each time. Our project aims to show ‘Winning Rate’ and ‘WPA factor’ in real-time, with the algorithm that fits KBO situation.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
\quad Baseball, even though the myriad scandals, attracts more and more fans and is becoming more nationwide sports. There is a major  problem that, though baseball fans are inflowing, it’s hard for beginners to understand the rules and catch situation of the match. Though baseball is much more a number-oriented sport than any others such as soccer or basketball, the classical stats do not fully reflect the match stream and evaluate the value of the players properly. However, in MLB, a lot of sabermetricians have already quantified vague situations and values in numerical way, and KBO tends to follow it. (i.e Babip, OPS, etc..). Korean baseball websites nowadays use the same WPA algorithm which had been used in earlier days of MLB, so the differences between two leagues are not considered. We wanted to solve this problem by creating our own WPA algorithm based on KBO, which not only calculates the stats suitable for KBO, but also analyzes winning possibilities of each team and the impacts each players make. We also focus on helping beginners to understand baseball.
\quad We will make KBO winning rate DB and we are going to put that into our program. The program  represents ongoing situation of the match and each team’s winning possibilities simultaneously. Also, by showing quantified stats such as batters’ WPA or pitchers’ WAR , it shows how much powerful the player is(or has been) throughout the game, seasons or his entire career. Whether baseball match is underway or not, the program will show player rank categorized by players, teams, or positions according to user’s request.
\quad It is not just ‘Baseball statistic calculator’, but also somewhat like websites such as Statiz or KBReport. The software indicates different types of statistical analysis, and shows them in visualized ways. We thought that current WPA algorithm used in korean web sites does not fit korean baseball situation. That is why we have started this project.

This project is composed of 4 steps.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Crawl the data of  last 10 seasons of KBO from baseball statistics websites. 
\item Compute the data to make some statistics.
\item Apply the statistics to WPA algorithm.
\item Real-time data capturing and showing the winning rate and WPA.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Development Environment}



\subsection{Choice of Software Development Platform}


\subsubsection{Which platform and why? (e.g.\ , Windows, Linux, Web, or etc.\ )}
\begin{itemize}
\item We adopted Windows, because there are some merit when we choose Windows. First of all, the percentage of all Windows user is almost 85\%. Since we want to emphasize on majority, we chose Windows. Second, because of encoding compatibility. For more convenience, it’s much better to share encoding method in OS, web server, database.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Which programming language and why?}
\begin{itemize}
\item  We used both python and Java. At first we used only python 2.7 to crawl html source, to parse tag data and manipulate date with python DB driver. But pyhon 2.7 had problem of unicode encoding. 
Because the web site that we wanted to crawl was encoded with 'utf-8', but python doesn't support it.
So we have to think another IDE. Two candidates was python 3.5, who support 'utf-8' and Java with a friendly programming language. With a contempletation, we decided that crawl, parsing and DB manipulation by using python 3.5 and the others, GUI, etc. by Java. That's because we had not enough time to learn a new Jave crawling, parsing code, but only to have time to transplant python 2.7 code into python 3.5. And we were not sure whether python 3.5 is an effective tool for GUI making, so we adopted Java IDE Netbeans which support easy GUI method.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Provide a cost estimation for your built.\\
 (including any purchase of software/hardware)}
\begin{itemize}
\item human labor - 0 \\
Our group constitute of four members who all do this group term project voluntarily. So human labor cost is zero.
\item software cost - 0  \\
Our group will make program with open source API,  which costs zero for academic purpose.
\item hardware cost - 0  \\
Our group uses our existing laptop to simulate or implement our program. There is no need to buy other hardware. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Provide clear information of your development environment.\\
(e.g., version of software, OS version, your computer resources)}
\begin{itemize}
\item OS \\
Windows 10 pro(10586.218 build)
\item Language Set \\
Korean
\item Computer Mode l\\
MSI GT60
\item Processor \\
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3600QM	CPU @ 2.4GHz
\item Main Memory \\
8GB RAM
\item Internet Connection \\
IPTIME WiFi
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Software in use}


\subsubsection{Any existing software or algorithm in use? (doing a similar task as
your proposal; provide a proper reference if there is any)}
\begin{itemize}
\item There is no similar software computing WPA, after Tom Tango introduced concepted of WPA. But, there is several websites or spreadsheet providing 
each statement winning rate. For MLB, there is a site called 'The Book'. It is made by Tom Tango who designed many good index including WPA. 'Statiz', 
'KBReport' are sites providing many baseball stats for KBO.

\subsection{MongoDB}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering\includegraphics[width=6cm]{mongo1}
\caption{MongoDB Logo}
\end{figure}
In order to execute the baseball.ai file, we first need MongoDB. Many exe file don’t need any language program or other platforms because they all aimed to just ‘execute’. However, this baseball.ai file has to be installed to get to the database created by file. MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database. It’s classified as a NoSQL database, and it avoids the traditional table-based relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. With the use of MongoDB, much of the functionality can be accessed through JAVA and python. MongoDB can be used as a file system, taking advantage of load balancing and data replication features over multiple machines for storing files. Files can be distributed and copied multiple times between machines transparently, thus effectively creating a load-balanced and fault-tolerant system. \\
Installation MongoDB on windows.\\

\subsubsection{Step1}\\
Visit downloads page and find your version of Windows. We are going to place all these files directly inside a directory C:/mongodo/. So once the download finishes, extract the zip and open the folders until you find /bin/ with a few other files. Select all these and cut/paste into our new C:/mongodb/directory.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering\includegraphics[width=6cm]{mongo2}

http://www.mongodb.org/downloads\\
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering\includegraphics[width=6cm]{mongo3}
\caption{version/os check}
\end{figure}
Check your version and OS then downloads.\\ \\


\subsubsection{Step2}\\
Add route. Add new route named MONGODB\_HOME and put the address on which you uncompressed.\\
Revise Path as showed below.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering\includegraphics[width=6cm]{mongo4}
\caption{system variable editting}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Step3}\\
Now, inside this folder alongside /bin create a new folder named "log" which will store all the MongoDB system logs. We also need to create two external directories for data storage, C:/data/ and C:/data/db.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering\includegraphics[width=6cm]{mongo5}
\caption{data storage directory}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Step4}\\
After creating new directory, and put ‘mongod’ on the DOS command. Then we can see the server is on like below. 
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering\includegraphics[width=6cm]{mongo6}
\caption{db creation using CMD}
\end{figure}
Then, let’s put new command and put word ‘mongo’’. If you are succeed to follow up to here, you can see the databased to ‘test’ , which means that it’s successfully installed.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering\includegraphics[width=6cm]{mongo7}
\caption{connect on database 'test'}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Step5}\\
If we open up the command prompt and run cd C:/mongodb/bin, we are looking to start the mongod.exe in shell, but after running this you’ll notice the operation will freeze when listening for connections. Well it’s not actually frozen, we are running Mongo directly through the terminal.\\
So, to start comman Mongo automatically as a Windows Service, first create a log file and configuration for the service. The code below executes creating the log file.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering\includegraphics[width=6cm]{mongo8}
\caption{creating log file}
\end{figure}
Now run the next two lines in terminal to create the service and get it started.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering\includegraphics[width=6cm]{mongo9}
\caption{creating service and starts}
\end{figure}
Following line shows all current databases on the server:

\subsection{BaseballAI.exe}
\subsubsection{Search Player}\\
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering\includegraphics[width=6cm]{proguidesplayer}
\caption{Search Player}
\end{figure}
You can enter the name of player you want. By doing so, you can get his WPA.

\subsubsection{Search Match}\\
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering\includegraphics[width=6cm]{proguidesmatch}
\caption{Search Match}
\end{figure}
You can select the date of match, then you can get all the list of the matches on that date.

\subsubsection{Winrate Graph}\\
\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Winrate Graph}
\end{figure}
The win-rate for all innings of each teams’ are showed in linear graph.


\section{Discussion}
We decided to use python because python is a handy programming language to deal with. Our   
real purpose was to crawl data about korea baseball league, which includes the name(korean). Because python 2.7 doesn't support unicode, at first we didn't know how to handle korean encoding.
But at last, we transfer to python 3.5 and java who is free from unicode problem. During that transition, we had to amend what we had done partly or entirely, and it took a non trivial time to accomplish that. That was our first challenge. Second, about parsing. Because our program uses crawled data from HTML source, it is impossible to avoid parsing problem. The basic principle of parsing is quite simple. But like a many cases, the applicated, nested ones made us feel terrible. Sometimes, it tooks 3 to 4 days to parse one web site. Because both python and parsing is something we had never used before, that may be the reason why we had such a difficulties.
And, about non-technical difficulties. this might be related to technical problem.. Because we all members are technically not proficient, so there was some obstacle when we take about out project, or program. For example, our members was distributed their task one by one. But because computer software is inter-related, there is some time one should know other software's basic things. But in terms of that, we were insufficient. And that makes inter-communication more difficult, slows down the talking. 
Through entire curriculum of our department, this class, firstly and mostly, provide students with practical application of what we learn by doing a project. So except for experienced students who did many project before this class, other class including us must be embrassed. But the more milestone of project we finish, the more we could get relief and we were suprised with ourselves that we could do such a things. Especially we really appreciate you and this class that We improved our practical skill by doing this project.
